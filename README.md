# How do I approach designing software?
I like to fully understand the requirements before I start to do anything so I looked at the requirements for this course which was to re-make a scene. I felt that I could do this better if I took my own picture so I chose some objets that I felt would give me a challenge but not be too difficult. I'm glad I did in the end because there was so much to learn for this course in a small time frame. I had to really break things down into small chunks to make sure I understood the different concepts being taught. I will continue to use these practices in my future designs as they get more complex.

# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I was learning a lot of new things while working on this project so I had to take it slow and make incremental steps. I started by just making some primitive shapes and placing them in their relative position around the scene. I then had to add some colors and get my shapes proportions correct and put them together. After this I had to add some textures to my objecs which means I had to re-design my shaders. Finally, I added lighting to my scene to make it look a bit more realistic. This project was a great reinforcement to my mindeset of make and test small chunks of code at a time.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I will one day go into game development so understand what goes on under the hood and how to apply realistic shaders to my scenes are a definite plus. I will continue to grow my skills though since I know this is only the beginning of what is possible.
